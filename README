GtkGLCanvas OpenGL Widget for GTK+ 3
------------------------------------

This library provides an OpenGL drawing area widget for GTK+ 3.0. Context
creation is platform-independent and possible under X11 as well as Windows.

Framebuffer configurations are selected via *Visuals* that can be filtered and
sorted arbitrarily. The library supports creation of pre-3.1 legacy contexts
as well as OpenGL 3.1+ Core, Compatibility and (still experimental) OpenGL ES
contexts.

The library is integrated into the Glade UI designer and GNU's pkg-config
mechanism. GtkGLCanvas closely interacts with GLEW for extension loading and
requires libGLEW to be present on the target system.

The project is released under the GNU GPL Version 3 (See LICENSE for details).
